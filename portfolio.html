              <p>This video was created for a local church looking to raise funds for building expansion. I began the project by sitting down the fundraising committee leaders and asking what their goals were. I was able to coordinate the taping of personal interviews and special events over a few week span. After submitting the inital draft, there were 2 rounds of revisions before the final product was delivered.</p>
