tl;dr Long hiatus. Learned lots. Ready to make waves.

Hello there, darling...
-------------------
So it's been a good year and a half since I wrote on this blog. A lot has changed since that time. I hope to post a few stories about what happened in that span. Let's see if I am up to it.  

Local Jekyll
---------------------
The most immediate change is that I am writing this post locally on my machine. Up to this point, I have used a Chromebook for my primary development machine (when not at work, where a lovely dual-screen PC setup was my workstation). On the Chromebook, I generally just wrote blog posts in a Google Doc and copy/pasted them over to the Github editor directly. I'd use the Github web UI to upload photos and make edits as needed. That workflow worked decently enough, but was very clunky. It was the separate commit for every typo/edit that really annoyed me.

Recently, I've started using a Mac laptop for my development machine. Access to a first class command line has been a breath of fresh air. One of the first things I tried to do was run Jekyll locally so I could test out and edit posts before committing them to Github Pages. After a bit of strong-arming Jekyll to mesh with my (much) older Jekyll config, things are working smoothly. Quite smoothly.

I'm hoping to cut out 15-20 minutes every few days to write little posts here and there. Nothing revolutionary, but something.

Dueces!
