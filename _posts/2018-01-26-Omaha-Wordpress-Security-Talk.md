tl;dr Slides from a talk given at the Wordpress Omaha meetup over basic security

# Wordpress Omaha

I was invited to give a talk at the Omaha Wordpress meetup a few weeks ago. I was told that the topic of discussion was open for me to select, but should be 'admin' related. Having gone through multiple security issues stemming from insecure sites that (mostly) clients were responsbile for, I thought it would be helpful to share some of my past blunders in hopes that I can keep someone from following my mistakes. The presentation focused on practical examples that a site admin can use to harden their Wordpress site and keep them from being low hanging fruit for a hacker.

# Photos!

I like to try and take a photo with the audience for any of my talks. One of the Midland Code Academy students that came to listen to the talk brought a selfie stick...needless to say, I'd never used one before...
