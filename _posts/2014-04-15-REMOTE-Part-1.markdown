tl;dr Can you have an amazing company culture while embracing remote workers?

I believe that you can. The internet has broken down the barriers for working remotely. Modern companies are taking advantage of hiring the best and brightest workers from around the globe instead of the available and adequate workers who live within driving distance. But there are still those out there who believe that a company cannot thrive when it’s employees are not occupying the same floor space.

Remote work intrigues me, personally, because my chosen profession is often used as the poster child for remote work: programming. Tools for communication, collaboration and productivity can all be used online. I understand how remote work can succeed because I use those tools every day sitting at my desk, but I wanted to get a broader look at how a modern company views remote working. So I picked up a book.

Remote: Office Not Required, by Jason Fried and DHH of Basecamp (formerly 37Signals) walks through every argument against remote working and systematically demonstrate how ever the most hip, cultured company can support remote work and still thrive.

Over the next few blog posts, I’m going to pull out certain excerpts of the book to address certain concerns about remote work that I have heard personally.
