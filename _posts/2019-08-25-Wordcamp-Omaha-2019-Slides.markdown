tl;dr Headless Wordpress with WPGraphQL!

---

This past Saturday, I had the pleasure of speaking at Wordcamp Omaha. This was my second time speaking at Wordcamp and I always enjoy it. There's just a good _vibe_ at Worcamp, ya kno?

Unfortunately, I signed up to speak about using GraphQL with Wordpress many months ago. Since the time I signed up, the kids went back to school, I started a new job, and The International 9 was taking place. Needless to say, I didn't practice as much as I should have and the rawness was probably apparent to those in attendance.

I felt like the talk went, overall, very well. I'm hoping that my crazy nervous energy was enough to trigger some folks to check out the awesomeness that is GraphQL.
