    <p>
      I absolutely love my family. God has blessed with me with the best wife a man
      could ever ask for. I have a two wonderful children who are the light of my world 
      and two dogs who continue to make life challenging.

      <h2>Technology</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      I have been enamored with technology since an early age. I love to tinker and solve problems.
      The level of creation that you can attain with technology is amazing. Code = Legos. Building
      something from nothing is a awe-inspring process.

      <h2>Learning</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      I love to learn. There are no failures, only learning opportunities.
      I am not afraid to try something new. As cliche as it is, I try to move fast and break things.
      I consider myself a life long learner.
