    <h2>My Family</h2>
    <p>
      <i class='icon-group icon-3x home-icons'></i>
      I absolutely love my family. God has blessed with me with the best wife a man
      could ever ask for. I have a wonderful daughter who is the light of my world.
      I have two dogs (well, maybe one and a half...) who provide me hours of enjoyment.

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>
      <i class='icon-desktop icon-3x home-icons'></i>
      I have been enamored with technology since an early age. I love to tinker and solve problems.
      The level of creation that you can attain with technology is amazing. Building
      something from nothing is a awe-inspring process. Not to mention just dang cool.

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>
      <i class='icon-cogs icon-3x home-icons'></i>
      I love to learn. I love to fail, because it means that I am learning.
      But if I am going to fail, I try to fail as fast as possible so I can pick
      myself up and move on. I am not afraid to try something new.
      I consider myself a life long learner.
