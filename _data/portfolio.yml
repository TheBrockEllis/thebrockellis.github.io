  title: Halltogether
  subtitle: Residence Hall management app
  comment: College is often a culture shock for new students living away from home for the first time. Their first semester experience is crucial to their future success as a student. Our app helps colleges make sure the living experience is as smooth as can be by streamlining roommate selection, room placement, applications & contracts, and residence hall communication between students.

  title: CashDepositWatch
  subtitle: PWA for petty-cash management 
  comment: I work at a coffeeshop and they use Square. When they made nightly cash deposits into the safe, there was no way of tracking who did it and when, besides scribbing it on a piece of paper. This Github Pages-hosted PWA allows the baristas to create deposits and for the bookkeeper in charge of taking the deposits to the bank to confirm the totals.

  title: Dan Lebatard Show Wiki
  subtitle: A PWA for a radio show
  comment: I love the Dan Lebatard Show from ESPN Radio. I listen to their podcast religiously. However, the show has been going on for 15+ years now and there is a tremendous amount of inside jokes. I threw together this site to try and make a central repo for all show knowledge. It's a Stencil PWA with a Wordpress backend. It's also the worst deployment in the history of forever.

  title: Railcrossing
  subtitle: Mobile app for being alerted about delays
  comment: Fremont is a hub of activity of the railroad. We've got major lines crisscrossing town that often times block auto traffic for quite a while. The city of Fremont installed sensors on 4 critical crossings in town and threw the data on a (90s looking) webpage. We assembled a team, scraped the data from the city site, set up our own API, and built a mobile app where people can see crossing statues and also be notified when a train is blocking the track at a certain time.

  title: Pegrider
  subtitle: Point to point transportation system
  comment: The Milady Coffeehouse, located in downtown Fremont, wanted to help Midland University students who didn't own cars get to the shop for late night events. We developed a ride sharing system that was more akin to a city bus than to Uber. It allowed the coffeeshop to create trips between the two locations, and for students to sign up for a ride. It included integrations for using the phones GPS, geolocation, and Stripe payments.

  title: LifeHouse website
  subtitle: New Wordpress site for local non-profit 
  comment: LifeHouse is a non-profit based in Fremont, NE that was recently formed when two smaller non-profits merged (Care Corps and Low Income Minsitry). A new website was needed due to rebranding and expanded offerings. Hosted on Flywheel, the new Wordpress is very thorough and meets the clients exact needs. Training was done for web admins on-site for long term maintenance.

  title: First Lutheran Church website
  subtitle: Designed and launched to replace Filemaker Pro site
  comment: Our church website was in dire need of an update. They couldn't make changes as often as they wanted to and it was visually displeasing. I set up a Wordpress site for them to iterate on the design, migrated the site to their host and helped update DNS settings. I'm no designer, but the site ended up looking quite nice.
