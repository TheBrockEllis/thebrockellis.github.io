    "comment": "I love the Dan Lebatard Show from ESPN Radio. I listen to their podcast religiously. Howver, the show has been going on for 15+ years now and there is a tremendous amount of inside jokes. I threw together this site to try and make a central repo for all show knowledge. It's a Stencil PWA with a Wordpress backend. It's also the worst deployment in the history of forever.",

    "comment": "Our church website was in dire need of an update. They couldn't make changes as often as they wanted to and it was visually displeasing. I set up a Wordpress site for them to iterate on the design, migrated the site to their host and helped update DNS settings. I'm no designer, but the site ended up looking quite nice.",
